## What is this?
I use the repo to quickly test very experemental features for my game engine [Monarch](https://github.com/Assassinsorrow/Monarch) \
Everything in here most likely wont work because it is not thought out and there is a 99.9% chance that i implemented a feature as fast as possible without checking if it worked properly, if you want a stable release please check the [main engine repository](https://github.com/Assassinsorrow/Monarch)
